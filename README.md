COSC1046 - Introduction to Computer Science @ Algoma University | Assignment 4 - Part B - Question 1

Part B: Write code and test the solutions for the following problems from the textbook. Submit the .java files for each question to CMS. 
The answers are due on October 21st and the programs are to be demonstrated to the Teaching Assistant (Tim) by October 27th. He will ask 
questions to make sure you understand the material. (HINT: If you demonstrate your programs before the due date, Tim can give you an 
opportunity to fix errors and redemonstrate).

1) [15 marks] Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 0
and 255 and displays it as a two-digit hex number. 
Hint: use modulus and integer division to isolate the two digits. (You cannot use the
Integer.valueOf() method.)

Sample runs:

    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 124 [Enter]
    The hex value is 7C
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 13 [Enter]
    The hex value is 0D
    
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 165 [Enter]
    The hex value is A5
    
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 210 [Enter]
    The hex value is D2
    
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 23 [Enter]
    The hex value is 17
    
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 255): 255 [Enter]
    The hex value is FF
